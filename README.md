## raspberrypi-docker-tensorflow-opencv

I will be adding a proper Readme.md to this repository very soon. 
Suffice to say that I am trying to build a docker container with version 2.3 of Tensorflow and also will be adding OpenCV and FFMPEG.

If you are looking for answers before I get to build the Readme.md I recommend you to watch how I built this repository on Youtube:

Below is modified and tested from The original [Step-By-Step Instructions](https://spltech.co.uk/how-to-run-object-detection-with-tensorflow-2-on-the-raspberry-pi-using-docker/)

These are the main steps you need to complete:
* Install and configure the PI Camera if you haven’t yet. See this separate guide I created to install it:
* How to Install a Raspberry PI Camera
* Install Docker(Instructions below)
* Download github repository at https://github.com/armindocachada/raspberrypi-docker-tensorflow-opencv and follow the setup instructions
* Setup X11 forwarding to camera
* Download model from model Zoo
* Run example
